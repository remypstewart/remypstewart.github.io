 # About 
 Hi there! My name is Remy Stewart, and I’m currently a second-year PhD student at Cornell University.<br>

 My program is housed in Sociology, but I’m lucky to be pursuing interdisciplinary training with Cornell’s Policy Analysis and Management and Information Science departments as well.<br>

 My research stands at the intersection between social stratification scholarship, public policy, urban studies, and computational social science.<br>

 I’d love to get in touch, and you can reach me through my email at [rps256@cornell.edu](mailto:rps256@cornell.edu).<br>
