 Hi there! My name is Remy Stewart, and I’m currently a second-year PhD student at Cornell University.\
 My program is housed in Sociology, but I’m lucky to be pursuing interdisciplinary training with Cornell’s Policy Analysis and Management and Information Science departments as well.\
 My research stands at the intersection between social stratification scholarship, public policy, urban studies, and computational social science.\
 I’d love to get in touch, and you can reach me through my email at [rps256@cornell.edu](mailto:rps256@cornell.edu).
